# CapsNet_SemanticSeg
The ultimate objective of this repo is to share code for pixel-wise semantic segmentation using Capsule networks by Geoffrey Hinton. In addition, I will be adding several implementations of Capsnet trained on MNIST (in the paper),CIFAR-100, PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, etc. We will go from basic Capsnet -> Capsnet trained on other datasets -> Capsnet for image classification -> Capsnet for object detection -> Capsnet for semantic segmentation. More can follow.

The paper can be found here : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829
